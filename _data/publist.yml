  - title: "Grey wolf genomic history reveals a dual ancestry of dogs."
    description: This paper analyses 72 ancient wolf genomes from the past 100,000 years and among others finds that most modern-day dogs derive their ancestry from two distinct wolf sources. It also quantifies selection directly using an ancient DNA time series. We confirmed that the strongest selection hit also has the youngest time to the most recent common ancestor in the whole genome, i.e. all wolves coalesce very quickly - we can infer this using only modern-day wolves complementing the time series approach.

  - title: "Multi-ancestry genetic study of type 2 diabetes highlights the power of diverse populations for discovery and translation."
    description: This paper did a GWAS meta analysis on ~1.2m subjects from diverse ancestries, identifying 338 distinct association signals for T2D. We looked at polygenic selection using Relate trees, and found some evidence of selection for increased T2D risk in 1000G African ancestry groups, which appears to be driven by a subset of SNPs that are also associated with weight/fat distribution in UKB.

  - title: "Sex-specific phenotypic effects and evolutionary history of an ancient polymorphic deletion of the human growth hormone receptor."
    description: This paper looks into the function and evolutionary history of the deletion of exon 3 in the growth hormone receptor. This deletion appears to be associated with protection from malnutrition and exhibits quite remarkable interactions with diet and sex in mice. This deletion is fixed in all archaics we looked at (incl. of lower coverage). Despite its apparent old age, it is segregating everywhere today and is found at especially low frequency in East Asia.

  - title: "Inferring population histories for ancient genomes using genome-wide genealogies."
    description: This paper extends Relate to work with ancient DNA and introduces Colate, a method for inferring coalescence rates between low-coverage (ancient) genomes. We also study geographic and temporal patterns of the TCC/TTC mutation rate change in moderns and 161 ancients, finding that it was already widespread >10k years ago and correlates with recent ancestry from a 10k year old Anatolian.
